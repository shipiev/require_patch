# RequirePatch

The gem adds a command "require_patch" that includes plugin patches. It used by my team to develop Redmine plugins

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'require_patch'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install require_patch
